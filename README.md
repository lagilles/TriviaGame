A fun trivia game testing your knowledge of beloved video game company, Nintendo! Utilizes Javascript timers and JQuery to make HTML and CSS dynamic.

- A trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.

- If the player selects the correct answer, show a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, display the next question -- do this without user input.

- The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

  - If the player runs out of time, tells the player that time's up. Wait a few seconds, then shows the next question.
  - If the player chooses the wrong answer, tell the player they selected the wrong option. Wait a few seconds, then shows the next question.

- On the final screen, show the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).
